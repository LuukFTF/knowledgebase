## Web Frameworks

### Fullstack

#### Stacks
XAMPP

#### Frontend JavaScript Frameworks
React   
Angular [ts]    
Vue

##### State Management
For larger apps, state managers may be needed.  

React: Redux        
Vue: Vues   
Angular: NGRX   
Appollo Client  

##### Server Side Rendering
Render React & Vue on the server as oppose to a client side SPA using NEXT (React) and NUXT (Vue)   

- Better SEO
- File System Routing
- Automatic Code Splitting
- Static Exporting
- CSS-in-JS

### UI/CSS Frameworks [CSS]
Great for prototyping and developers that are not design centered.

### Serverless Architecture (Cloud)
Server operations without actually needing your onw server (Backend/ Functions as a service)
AWS, Netlify    

### API-First Design
With more and more Internet of Things expect to see api-focused design  

### AI / Machine Learning & The Web
Machine learning & AI are growing in all areas of technology and can be usefull in web apps/ services
